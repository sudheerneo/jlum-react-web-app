I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God, where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate (Acts 1:9, 10; Hebrews 7:25, Hebrews 9:24; Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1-2)."]}),(0,t.jsxs)("p",{children:[(0,t.jsx)("strong",{children:"The Person and work of the Holy Spirit"}),(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),"I believe that the Holy Spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and that He is the Supernatural agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption (John 16:8-11; 2 Corinthians 3:6; 1 Corinthians 12:12-14; Romans 8:9; Ephesians 5:18)."]}),(0,t.jsxs)("p",{children:[(0,t.jsx)("strong",{children:"Salvation"}),(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),"I believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins (Ephesians 2:8-10; John 1:12; Ephesians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:18-19)."]}),(0,t.jsxs)("p",{children:[(0,t.jsx)("strong",{children:"Security of the Believer"}),(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),"I believe that those who are truly redeemed are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever (John 6:37-40, 10:27-30; Romans 8:1, 38, 39; 1 Corinthians 1:4-8; 1 Peter 1:5). I believe it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word which clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh (Romans 13:13,14; Galatians 5:13; Titus 2:11-15)."]}),(0,t.jsxs)("p",{children:[(0,t.jsx)("strong",{children:"The Church"}),(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),"I believe that the church, which is the body and espoused bride of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of all born-again persons of this present age (Ephesians 1:22,23 5:25-27; 1 Corinthian 12:12-14; 2 Corinthians 11:2). I believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament scriptures (Acts 14:27, 18:22, 20:17, 1 Timothy 3:1-3 & Titus 1:5-11). I believe in the autonomy of the local church, free of any external authority and control (Acts 13:1-4, 15:19-31, 20:28; Romans 16:1,4; 1 Corinthians 3:9, 16, 1 Corinthians 5: 4-7, 13; 1 Peter 5:1-4).
